There once was {alan} {adjective1} young girl named Cinderella who lived with her {adjective2} stepmother and two {adjective3} stepsisters.
She waited on them hand and {part_body}, but they treated her like {alan} {noun1}.
Cinderella heard about a ball the prince was throwing, but she didn't have {alan} {adjective4} gown to wear.
Then, out of the clear, blue {noun2}, her fairy {noun3}-mother appeared and waved her magic {noun4}.
Cinderella's ragged clothes turned into a beautiful {noun5}, and her worn work shoes became a pair of glass {plural_noun}.
Cinderella went to the ball and danced with Prince {male_name}, who fell madly in love with her.
But at the stroke of midnight she had to flee, losing one of her glass {plural_noun}.
The prince travelled throughout the kingdom, trying to find the matching {plural_noun}.
He visited the {noun_place} of every young girl until he found Cinderella, who had the other half of the {plural_noun}.
Prince {male_name} and Cinderella soon were married and lived {adverb} ever after!
